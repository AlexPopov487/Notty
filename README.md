A simple android app to create notifications

**Features**
* 4 kind of notes are supported according to the urgency level (not urgent, urgent, very urgent) + default. The urgency level is 
set during note creation/editing via dedicaed selector
* List of all notes can be filtered to display notes of a srecific urgency level
* Swipe-to-delete functionality is supported
* Note can be edited by tapping on it
* A completely empty note cannot be added
* The app is fully translated in Russian and English

**What needs to be improved**
* By now, the note list filtering accoring to note urgency leaves much to be desired. I'm gonna fix some occured bugs as soon as I have some spare time
